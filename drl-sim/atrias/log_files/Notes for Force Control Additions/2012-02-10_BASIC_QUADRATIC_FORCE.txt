Basic Force Control 1.0

We took data from:
atrias_120209_172236.log


Used the script:
parse_data.m

To process the deflections in the first stance phase.  We reflected the profile about its peak to minimize the effect of losses in the system


We then took a quadratic regression of defA and defB as a quick approximation


defA = -11.455*t^2 + 3.1387*t;
defB = -10.890*t^2 + 2.9839*t;
