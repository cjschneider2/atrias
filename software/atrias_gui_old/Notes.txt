* Automatically zero torques on takedown
* Zero out controller output struct before sending to controller
* Make sure to free array data in ByteArray's
* Controller_state_machine and GUI need to verify library functions when
  controller is loaded and throw an error on failure
* GUI load controller GUI when controller's box is ticked and library when
  controller tab is actually opened
* When loading controller GUI description file ensure all loaded GUI element
  names are prefixed with the controller's package name
* Don't detect controller packages names taht are not legal GUI element names
* Do all lib functions need to be defined (takedown?)

* Smart verification of controller GUI element names
* Default value loading/saving for controllers
